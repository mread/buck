   * file is a JAR containing the files necessary to use
   * this {@link JavaLibrary} as a GWT module. Normally, this includes Java source code, a .gwt.xml
   * file, and static resources, such as stylesheets and image files.
   * <p>
   * In the event that this {@link JavaLibrary} cannot be represented as a GWT module (for example,
   * if it has no {@code srcs} or {@code resources} of its own, but only exists to export deps),
   * then the flavor will be {@link Optional#absent()}.
   * <p>
   * Note that the output of the {@link BuildRule} for this flavor may contain
   * {@code .class} files. For example, if a third-party releases its {@code .class} and
   * {@code .java} files in the same JAR, it is common for a {@code prebuilt_jar()} to declare that
   * file as both its {@code binary_jar} and its {@code source_jar}. In that case, the output of
   * the {@link BuildRule} will be the original JAR file, which is why it would contain
   * {@code .class} files.
